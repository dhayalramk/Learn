- Before starting this article, got doubt about [[HLD vs SLD]], so understood the basics
- Helpful tools to design: [[Tools / Whimsical]], [[Tools / Google Drawings]], [[Tools / Miro]]
- API Design Choices
	- Rest API
		- Properties: Resource Oriented, Data Driven, Flexible
		- Data: JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, Plain Text
		- Use Cases: Web based apps, cloud apps, client-server apps, cloud computing services, developer APIs
	- RPC
		- Properties: action-oriented, high performance
		- Data: JSON, XML, Thrift, Protobuf, FlatButters
		- Use Cases: complex microservice system, IoT Applications
	- GrapfQL
		- Properties: Single Endpoint, Strongly typed request, no data over fetching, self-documenting
		- Data: JSON
		- Use Cases: High performance mobile apps, complex systems and microservice based architectures
- Ways
	- Synchronous
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service A's -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service B's
	- Async Messaging
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service A's -> (Message) -> Queue -> (Message & Subscribe) -> Service B's
	- Publish - Subscribe
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Producer (Publish) -> Topic -> (Subscribe) -> Service A or Service B
- Scalability
  collapsed:: true
	- [[HLD / Replication]]
		- Is the data important enough to make the copies? How important is it to keep the copies the same?
			- Active Data -> (Data Replication) -> Mirrored Data
	- [[HLD / Partitioning]]
		- Partition contains a subset of the whole table. Each partition is stored on a separate server.
			- Horizontal Partitioning -> N1, N2,.., Nx -> Vertical Partitioning
	- [[HLD / Sharding]]
		- Sharding allows a system to scale as data increases, but not all data is suitable for sharding.
			- Collection 1 -> [Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, ..., Shard N]
	- [[HLD / Load Balancing]]
		- Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or resources.
			- Upload Service -> Load Balancer -> [Image Processor, Image Processor, Image Processer]

					- Example: Social media design
						- Focus on photos and timeline generation services.
						- Lesser focus on: User registration and follow another user.

	- Step 3: Explore the Design: Deep-Dive - 10 Minutes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Non-Functional Requirements
			- Transactions: Database that offers ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) Properties
			- Data freshness: If an online requires fresh data, think about how to speed up the data ingestion, processing and query process
			- Data size: If the data size is small enough to fit into memory (up to hundreds of GBs), you can place it in memory. However, RAM is prone to data loss, so if you can't afford to lose data, you must find a way to make it persistent.
			- Partitioning: If the volume of data you need to store is large, you may want to partition the database to balance storage and query traffic
			- Offline processing: if some processing can be done offline or delayed, you may want to rely on message queues and consumers.
			- Access patterns: Revisit the data access pattern, QPS number, and read/write ration, and consider how they impact your choices for databases, database schemas, and indexing options.
	- Step 4: Improve the Design (Bottlenecks and Scale) - 10 Minutes
	  collapsed:: true
		- Are there any bottlenecks in this system? how well does it scale?
		- Evaluate if the system can operate effectively under different conditions and has the flexibility to support future growth.
		- Consider these points:
			- Single points of failure: Is there  a single point that could cause the entire system to fail? How could the system be more robust and maintain uptime?
			- Data replication: Is the data important enough to make copies? how important is it to keep all copies the same?
			- CDNs: Does it provide a service for people all over the world? Would data centers in different parts of the world make it faster?
			- High traffic: Are there any special situations, like when many people use the system simultaneously, that could make it slow or even break it?
			- Scalability: How can the system work for 10 times more people?
		- Message Queues and Public or Subscribe
			- By breaking down process and implementing queuing mechanisms to manage traffic, systems can be optimized for high performance at scale
			- Message Queues (MQs): MQs are ideal for scenarios where processing jobs in a specific order is essential. They ensure that tasks are executed sequentially, maintaining the integrity of the workflow.
			- Publish-Subscribe (Pub Sub) systems: PubSub systems shine when it comes to disseminating events or notifications to a large number of recipients concurrently.

	- Web Protocols
		- Web protocols are the foundation of network communication, essential for the functioning of distributed systems. They include standards and rules for data exchange over a network, involving physical infrastructure like servers and client machines.
		- Network protocols ensure standardized communication amount machines, crucial for maintaining order and functionality in network interactions. The internet primarily uses two models, TCP/IP and OSI, to structure these communications.
		- TCP/IP Protocol and OSI Models
			- TCP/IP Protocol: Consists of four layers: Network Access, Internet, Transport and Application. It uses protocol like IP (Internet Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) to facilitate data transmission across network ideas.
			- OSI Model: A more conceptual, seven-layer model that provides a detailed breakdown of the network communication process.
		- TCP and UDP:
			- TCP: Focuses on reliable transmission, correcting errors like lost or out-of-order packets. It's suitable for applications where data accuracy is critical.
			- UDP: Offers faster transmission by eliminating error-checking processes. used in applications like live streaming where speed is preferred over accuracy.
		- HTTP and HTTPS
			- HTTP: An application layer protocol for transmitting hyperlinks and web content using request methods like GET and POST
			- HTTPS: Enhances HTTP with security features, encryption data to prevent unauthotized access.
		- TLS and Websockets
			- TLS (Transport Layer )
