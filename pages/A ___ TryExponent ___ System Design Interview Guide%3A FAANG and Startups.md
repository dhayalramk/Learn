- Before starting this article, got doubt about [[HLD vs SLD]], so understood the basics
- Helpful tools to design: [[Tools / Whimsical]], [[Tools / Google Drawings]], [[Tools / Miro]]
- API Design Choices
	- Rest API
		- Properties: Resource Oriented, Data Driven, Flexible
		- Data: JSON, XML, YAML, HTML, Plain Text
		- Use Cases: Web based apps, cloud apps, client-server apps, cloud computing services, developer APIs
	- RPC
		- Properties: action-oriented, high performance
		- Data: JSON, XML, Thrift, Protobuf, FlatButters
		- Use Cases: complex microservice system, IoT Applications
	- GrapfQL
		- Properties: Single Endpoint, Strongly typed request, no data over fetching, self-documenting
		- Data: JSON
		- Use Cases: High performance mobile apps, complex systems and microservice based architectures
- Ways
	- Synchronous
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service A's -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service B's
	- Async Messaging
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Service A's -> (Message) -> Queue -> (Message & Subscribe) -> Service B's
	- Publish - Subscribe
		- Client -> (HTTP Sync) -> Producer (Publish) -> Topic -> (Subscribe) -> Service A or Service B
- Scalability
	- [[HLD / Replication]]
		- Is the data important enough to make the copies? How important is it to keep the copies the same?
			- Active Data -> (Data Replication) -> Mirrored Data
	- [[HLD / Partitioning]]
		- Partition contains a subset of the whole table. Each partition is stored on a separate server.
			- Horizontal Partitioning -> N1, N2,.., Nx -> Vertical Partitioning
	- [[HLD / Sharding]]
		- Sharding allows a system to scale as data increases, but not all data is suitable for sharding.
			- Collection 1 -> [Shard 1, Shard 2, Shard 3, ..., Shard N]
	- [[HLD / Load Balancing]]
		- Load Balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers or resources.
			- Upload Service -> Load Balancer -> [Image Processor, Image Processor, Image Processer]
